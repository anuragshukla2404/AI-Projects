This allows, after training, the\\ngeneration of new samples by sampling the la-\\ntent representation according to this imposed\\ndistribution and then mapping back through the\\ndecoder.\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks\\nAnother approach to density modeling is the\\nGenerativeAdversarialNetworks ( GAN) intro-\\nduced by Goodfellow et al.
